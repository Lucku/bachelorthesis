abstract = {Intel{\textregistered} Software Guard Extensions (SGX) has an attestation capability that can be used to remotely provision secrets to an enclave. Use of Intel{\textregistered} SGX attestation and sealing has been described in [1]. This paper describes how the SGX attestation key are remotely provisioned to Intel{\textregistered} SGX enabled platforms, the hardware primitives used to support the process, and the Intel Verification Service that simplifies the verification of an SGX attestation. The paper also includes a short primer on the Intel{\textregistered} Enhanced Privacy Identifier which is signature algorithm used by Intel{\textregistered} SGX attestation architecture.},

abstract = {Our Black Hat 2016 talk SGX Secure Enclaves in Practice: Security and Crypto Review is the first public report about the security of Intel(R) Software Guard Extensions (SGX) based on actual SGX hardware and on Intel's software development toolchain for Windows and Linux. We describe yet undocumented aspects of SGX and present our new open-source tools released at Black Hat. This report is a non-technical summary of what we've done and discovered, and starts with a high-level introduction to SGX. For more details, refer to our slides and to our projects on GitHub: https:},

abstract = {Intel's  Software  Guard  Extensions (SGX)  is  a  set  of  extensions  to  the  Intel  architecture  that  aims  to  provide  integrity   and  privacy  guarantees  to  security-sensitive  computation  performed  on  a  computer  where  all  the  privileged  software (kernel,  hypervisor,  etc)  is  potentially  malicious.$\backslash$r$\backslash$rThis  paper  analyzes  Intel  SGX,  based  on  the 3  papers  that  introduced  it,  on  the  Intel  Software  Developer's  Manual (which  supersedes  the  SGX  manuals),  on  an  ISCA 2015  tutorial,   and  on  two  patents.  We  use  the  papers,  reference  manuals,   and  tutorial  as  primary  data  sources,   and  only  draw  on  the  patents  to  fill  in  missing  information.$\backslash$r$\backslash$rThis  paper's  contributions  are  a  summary  of  the  Intel-specific  architectural   and  micro-architectural  details  needed  to  understand  SGX,  a  detailed   and  structured  presentation  of  the  publicly  available  information  on  SGX,  a  series  of  intelligent  guesses  about  some  important  but  undocumented  aspects  of  SGX,   and  an  analysis  of  SGX's  security  properties.},
