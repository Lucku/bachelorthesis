abstract = {We introduce Intel{\textregistered} Software Guard Extensions (Intel{\textregistered} SGX) SGX2 which extends the SGX instruction set to include dynamic memory management support for enclaves. Intel{\textregistered} SGX is a subset of the Intel Architecture Instruction Set. SGX1 allows an application developer to build a trusted environment and execute inside that space. However SGX1 imposes limitations regarding memory commitment and reuse of enclave memory. The software developer is required to allocate all memory at enclave instantiation. This paper describes new instructions and programming models to extend support for dynamic memory management inside an enclave.},

abstract = {Cloud computing is clearly one of today's most enticing technology areas due, at least in part, to its cost-efficiency and flexibility. However, despite the surge in activity and interest, there are significant, persistent concerns about cloud computing that are impeding momentum and will eventually compromise the vision of cloud computing as a new IT procurement model. In this paper, we characterize the problems and their impact on adoption. In addition, and equally importantly, we describe how the combination of existing research thrusts has the potential to alleviate many of the concerns impeding adoption. In particular, we argue that with continued research advances in trusted computing and computation-supporting encryption, life in the cloud can be advantageous from a business intelligence standpoint over the isolated alternative that is more common today.},

abstract = {Recent trends towards database outsourcing, as well as concerns and laws governing data privacy, have led to great interest in enabling secure database services. Previous approaches to enabling such a service have been based on data encryption, causing a large overhead in query processing. We propose a new, distributed architecture that allows an organization to outsource its data management to two untrusted servers while preserving data privacy. We show how the presence of two servers enables efficient partitioning of data so that the contents at any one server are guaranteed not to breach data privacy. We show how to optimize and execute queries in this architecture, and discuss new challenges that emerge in designing the database schema.},

abstract = {Cipherbase is a comprehensive database system that provides strong end-to-end data confidentiality through encryption. Cipherbase is based on a novel architecture that combines an industrial strength database engine (SQL Server) with lightweight processing over encrypted data that is performed in secure hardware. Cipherbase has the smallest trusted computing base (TCB) among comparable systems and provides significant benefits over the state-of-the-art in terms of security, performance, and functionality. This paper presents a prototype of Cipherbase that uses FPGAs to provide secure processing and describes the system engineering details implemented to achieve competitive performance for transactional workloads. This includes hardware-software co-design issues (e.g. how to best offer parallelism), optimizations to hide the latency between the secure hardware and the main system, and techniques to cope with space inefficiencies. All of these optimizations were carefully designed not to affect end-to-end data confidentiality. Our experiments with TPC-C show that when customer data is strongly encrypted in Cipherbase, it can provide 90% the throughput of SQL Server operating over unencrypted data. Even when all data is strongly encrypted, Cipherbase achieves 40% the throughput of plaintext SQL Server.},

abstract = {Online applications are vulnerable to theft of sensitive information because adversaries can exploit software bugs to gain access to private data, and because curious or malicious administrators may capture and leak data. CryptDB is a system that provides practical and provable confidentiality in the face of these attacks for applica- tions backed by SQL databases. It works by executing SQL queries over encrypted data using a collection of efficient SQL-aware en- cryption schemes. CryptDB can also chain encryption keys to user passwords, so that a data item can be decrypted only by using the password of one of the users with access to that data. As a result, a database administrator never gets access to decrypted data, and even if all servers are compromised, an adversary cannot decrypt the data of any user who is not logged in. An analysis of a trace of 126 million SQL queries from a production MySQL server shows that CryptDB can support operations over encrypted data for 99.5% of the 128,840 columns seen in the trace. Our evaluation shows that CryptDB has low overhead, reducing throughput by 14.5% for phpBB, a web forum application, and by 26% for queries from TPC- C, compared to unmodifiedMySQL. Chaining encryption keys to user passwords requires 11–13 unique schema annotations to secure more than 20 sensitive fields and 2–7 lines of source code changes for three multi-user web applications.},

abstract = {Column-oriented database system architectures invite a re- evaluation of how and when data in databases is compressed. Storing data in a column-oriented fashion greatly increases the similarity of adjacent records on disk and thus opportuni- ties for compression. The ability to compress many adjacent tuples at once lowers the per-tuple cost of compression, both in terms of CPU and space overheads. In this paper, we discuss how we extended C-Store (a column-oriented DBMS) with a compression sub-system. We show how compression schemes not traditionally used in row- oriented DBMSs can be applied to column-oriented systems. We then evaluate a set of compression schemes and show that the best scheme depends not only on the properties of the data but also on the nature of the query workload.},

MONOMI introduces split client/server query execution, which can execute arbitrarily complex queries over encrypted data, as well as several techniques that improve performance for such workloads, including per-row precomputation, space-efficient encryption, grouped homomorphic addition, and pre-filtering. Since these optimizations are good for some queries but not others, MONOMI introduces a designer for choosing an efficient physical design at the server for a given workload, and a planner to choose an efficient execution plan for a given query at runtime. A prototype of MONOMI running on top of Postgres can execute most of the queries from the TPC-H benchmark with a median overhead of only 1.24× (ranging from 1.03×to 2.33×) compared to an un-encrypted Postgres database where a compromised server would reveal all data.},

VC3 runs on unmodified Hadoop, but crucially keeps Hadoop, the operating system and the hypervisor out of the TCB; thus, confidentiality and integrity are preserved even if these large components are compromised. VC3 relies on SGX processors to isolate memory regions on individual computers, and to deploy new protocols that secure distributed MapReduce computations. VC3 optionally enforces region self-integrity invariants for all MapReduce code running within isolated regions, to prevent attacks due to unsafe memory reads and writes. Experimental results on common benchmarks show that VC3 performs well compared with unprotected Hadoop; VC3's average runtime overhead is negligible for its base security guarantees, 4.5{%} with write integrity and 8{%} with read/write integrity.},

Sensitive data can leak from online data repositories for a variety of reasons: an adversary can exploit software vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to servers, curious or malicious administrators at a hosting provider can snoop on private data, and attackers with physical access to servers can steal data from disk and memory. An ideal solution to satisfying the dual goals of protecting data confidentiality and running computations is to enable a server to compute over encrypted data, without the server ever decrypting the data to plaintext. The authors introduce CryptDB, a practical system that explores an intermediate design point to provide confidentiality for applications that use database management systems (DBMS). CryptDB is the first practical system that can execute a wide range of SQL queries over encrypted data. CryptDB requires no changes to the internals of the DBMS server, and should work with most standard SQL DBMSes.},

abstract = {This article describes the major challenges and design considerations pertaining to database encryption. The article first presents an attack model and the main relevant challenges of data security, encryption overhead, key management, and integration footprint. Next, the article reviews related academic work on alternative encryption configurations pertaining to encryption locus; indexing encrypted data; and key management. Finally, the article concludes with a benchmark using the following design criteria: encryption configuration, encryption granularity and keys storage.},

@article{Karras2016,
abstract = {Today, outsourcing query processing tasks to remote cloud servers becomes a viable option; such outsourcing calls for encrypting data stored at the server so as to render it secure against eavesdropping adversaries and/or an honest-but-curious server itself. At the same time, to be efficiently managed, outsourced data should be indexed, and even adaptively so, as a side-effect of query processing. Computationally heavy encryption schemes render such outsourcing unattractive; an alternative, Order-Preserving Encryption Scheme (OPES), intentionally preserves and reveals the order in the data, hence is unattractive from the security viewpoint. In this paper, we propose and analyze a scheme for lightweight and indexable encryption, based on linear-algebra operations. Our scheme provides higher security than OPES and allows for range and point queries to be efficiently evaluated over encrypted numeric data, with decryption performed at the client side. We implement a prototype that performs incremental, query-triggered adaptive indexing over encrypted numeric data based on this scheme, without leaking order information in advance, and without prohibitive overhead, as our extensive experimental study demonstrates.},

abstract = {TrustedDB is an outsourced database prototype that allows clients to execute SQL queries with privacy and under regulatory compliance constraints without having to trust the service provider. TrustedDB achieves this by leveraging server-hosted tamper-proof trusted hardware in critical query processing stages. TrustedDB does not limit the query expressiveness of supported queries. And, despite the cost overhead and performance limitations of trusted hardware, the costs per query are orders of magnitude lower than any (existing or) potential future software-only mechanisms. TrustedDB is built and runs on actual hardware, and its performance and costs are},

The authors outline the performance\nimprovements that can be achieved by exploiting data compression in\nquery processing. The novel idea is to leave data in compressed state as\nlong as possible, and to only uncompress data when absolutely necessary.\nThey show that many query processing algorithms can manipulate\ncompressed data just as well as decompressed data, and that processing\ncompressed data can speed query processing by a factor much larger than\nthe compression factor},
