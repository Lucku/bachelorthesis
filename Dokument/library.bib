abstract = {Cloud computing is clearly one of today's most enticing technology areas due, at least in part, to its cost-efficiency and flexibility. However, despite the surge in activity and interest, there are significant, persistent concerns about cloud computing that are impeding momentum and will eventually compromise the vision of cloud computing as a new IT procurement model. In this paper, we characterize the problems and their impact on adoption. In addition, and equally importantly, we describe how the combination of existing research thrusts has the potential to alleviate many of the concerns impeding adoption. In particular, we argue that with continued research advances in trusted computing and computation-supporting encryption, life in the cloud can be advantageous from a business intelligence standpoint over the isolated alternative that is more common today.},

abstract = {CryptDB  has  been  proposed  as  a  practical   and  secure$\backslash$rmiddleware  to  protect  databases  deployed  on  semi-honest$\backslash$rcloud  servers.  While  CryptDB  provides  sufficient  protection$\backslash$runder  Threat-1,  here  we  demonstrate  that  when  CryptDB  is$\backslash$rdeployed  to  secure  the  cloud  hosted  database  of  a  realistic  web$\backslash$rapplication,  an  attacker  to  database  or  a  Malicious  Database$\backslash$rAdministrator (mDBA)  can  easily  steal  information,   and  even$\backslash$rescalate  his  privilege  to  become  the  administrator  of  the$\backslash$rweb  application.  Our  attacks,  fall  under  a  restricted  form$\backslash$rof  Threat-2  where  we  only  assume  that  the  attackers  or  the$\backslash$rmDBA  tampers  with  the  CryptDB  protected  database   and  is$\backslash$ropens  an  ordinary  user  account  through  the  web  application.$\backslash$rOur  attacks,  are  carried  out  assuming  perfectly  secure  proxy$\backslash$rand  application  servers.  Therefore,  the  attacks  work  without$\backslash$rrecovering  the  master  key  residing  on  the  proxy  server.

We  propose  a  number$\backslash$rof  practical  countermeasures  to  mitigate  attacks  targeting  the$\backslash$rintegrity  of  the  CryptDB  database.

@article{Popa2012,
abstract = {Theft of private information is a significant problem for online applications. Sensitive data can leak from online data repositories for a variety of reasons: an adversary can exploit software vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to servers, curious or malicious administrators at a hosting provider can snoop on private data, and attackers with physical access to servers can steal data from disk and memory. An ideal solution to satisfying the dual goals of protecting data confidentiality and running computations is to enable a server to compute over encrypted data, without the server ever decrypting the data to plaintext. The authors introduce CryptDB, a practical system that explores an intermediate design point to provide confidentiality for applications that use database management systems (DBMS). CryptDB is the first practical system that can execute a wide range of SQL queries over encrypted data. CryptDB requires no changes to the internals of the DBMS server, and should work with most standard SQL DBMSes.},

@article{Tu2013,
abstract = {MONOMI is a system for securely executing analytical workloads over sensitive data on an untrusted database server. MONOMI works by encrypting the entire database and running queries over the encrypted data. MONOMI introduces split client/server query execution, which can execute arbitrarily complex queries over encrypted data, as well as several techniques that improve performance for such workloads, including per-row precomputation, space-efficient encryption, grouped homomorphic addition, and pre-filtering. Since these optimizations are good for some queries but not others, MONOMI introduces a designer for choosing an efficient physical design at the server for a given workload, and a planner to choose an efficient execution plan for a given query at runtime. A prototype of MONOMI running on top of Postgres can execute most of the queries from the TPC-H benchmark with a median overhead of only 1.24× (ranging from 1.03×to 2.33×) compared to an un-encrypted Postgres database where a compromised server would reveal all data.},

@article{Karras2016,
abstract = {Today, outsourcing query processing tasks to remote cloud servers becomes a viable option; such outsourcing calls for encrypting data stored at the server so as to render it secure against eavesdropping adversaries and/or an honest-but-curious server itself. At the same time, to be efficiently managed, outsourced data should be indexed, and even adaptively so, as a side-effect of query processing. Computationally heavy encryption schemes render such outsourcing unattractive; an alternative, Order-Preserving Encryption Scheme (OPES), intentionally preserves and reveals the order in the data, hence is unattractive from the security viewpoint. In this paper, we propose and analyze a scheme for lightweight and indexable encryption, based on linear-algebra operations. Our scheme provides higher security than OPES and allows for range and point queries to be efficiently evaluated over encrypted numeric data, with decryption performed at the client side. We implement a prototype that performs incremental, query-triggered adaptive indexing over encrypted numeric data based on this scheme, without leaking order information in advance, and without prohibitive overhead, as our extensive experimental study demonstrates.},
