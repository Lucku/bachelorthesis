	\section*{Abstract}
	The storage and processing of data in a cloudbased environment is a challenging task from a security perspective. Remote systems cannot be fully trusted and might involve privileged software components corrupted by an adversary, willing to collect the stored data. Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) are the processing hardware vendor's approach to allow the work on data in a protected region in memory, leaving the Intel processor as the only part of the system, that has to be trusted. From a development point of view a officially released SDK offers an intuitive way to use the protected memory by defining 'Enclaves' as independent units that live inside of it. Functions that process sensitive data are declared as part of an enclave, that is later included as a library by an ordinary application, making calls to its interface.
	%TODO of course that has to be done at the end :)
